## Overview

This webhook response is triggered when an relation between objects is created.

For example, in a business management system, a company may want to establish an association between a custom object record and a contact. In this case:

- The **second object** (contact) would represent a person associated with the custom object record.
- The **first object** (custom object) could represent an entity such as a project or a transaction.
- The system allows for dynamic relationships between entities, facilitating better data management.

The webhook response follows the JSON schema below:
