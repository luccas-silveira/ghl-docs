## Overview [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/webhook/AssociationCreate/\#overview "Direct link to Overview")

This webhook response is triggered when a new association is created between objects, such as linking contacts to custom objects. Currently, only contact-to-contact , contact to custom object and custom object to custom object associations are supported. There are plans to expand support for additional associations in the future.

For example, in a real estate system, a company may want to associate potential buyers with specific properties. In this case:

- The **first object** (buyer) would be a custom object representing the interested person.
- The **second object** (property) would be a custom object representing the real estate listing.
- The **association label** might be "Interested Buyer," indicating that the buyer has shown interest in the property.
- The system could store multiple buyers per property (many-to-many relationship), allowing for flexible tracking of interest.
